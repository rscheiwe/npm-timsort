# timSort-node: Node.js Package for Python's Sorting Algorithm, Timsort

Timsort is Python's default sorting algorithm (`.sort()`), later adopted by Java in SE 7. It was designed by Tim Peters (of, "The Zen of Python") "outside" of the laboratory in order to approach data more likely to be encountered in real-world scenarios. Timsort is stable and as fast as merge sort, with an average big-O of `n log n`. The original algorithm was written by Peters in C and can be found [here](http://svn.python.org/projects/python/trunk/Objects/listobject.c).
